# Green Skills and AI Learning Journey  

## Overview  

This repository documents my learning journey in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** as part of the **Green Skills and AI** course. Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience with both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning techniques, applied various machine learning models, and explored essential tools like GitHub.  

## Learning Highlights  

### ðŸ”¹ **Supervised Learning**  
- **Regression Models**: Implemented **Linear Regression** for predictive analysis.  
- **Classification Models**: Worked with **Decision Trees** and **Random Forest** for classification tasks.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Unsupervised Learning**  
- **Clustering**: Explored **K-Means** and other clustering techniques.  
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **t-SNE** for data visualization and feature reduction.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Hands-on Experience**  
- Engaged in quizzes and practical exercises to reinforce theoretical concepts.  
- Applied ML techniques to real-world datasets.  

### ðŸ”¹ **Version Control with GitHub**  
- Learned GitHub fundamentals from **February 12th to February 20th**.  
- Practiced repository management, branching, and collaboration workflows.  

## Repository Contents  
- ðŸ“‚ **Supervised Learning**: Notebooks and code implementations.  
- ðŸ“‚ **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering and dimensionality reduction experiments.  
- ðŸ“‚ **GitHub Learning**: Notes and practice exercises.  

## Future Plans  
- Further exploration of **deep learning** and **advanced AI techniques**.  
- Working on real-world projects and contributing to open-source AI initiatives.
